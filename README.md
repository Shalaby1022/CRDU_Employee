# CRUD_Employee
CRUD_EMP is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using ASP.NET Core MVC. It allows you to manage a list of employees, including their details such as name, age, salary, email, office, and password.

# Features :

1- View a list of all employees with basic details.
2- View detailed information about a specific employee.
3- Create a new employee record with all required details.
4- Edit the details of an existing employee.
5- Delete an employee from the database.

# Technologies Used :

ASP.NET Core MVC
Entity Framework Core
Microsoft SQL Server (Database)
HTML/CSS
Bootstrap (for styling)

# Notes :

1- The application uses basic validation to ensure that all required fields are provided while creating/editing an employee record.
2- The password field is stored in the database as plaintext. For production applications, it's essential to use proper encryption/hashing for passwords.
3- The application does not implement user authentication and authorization. This feature should be added in a real-world application to ensure proper security.
